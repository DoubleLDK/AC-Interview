# AI Coach For Tech Interview

This guide is to help you efficiently use AI Coach to prepare for software engineering interviews include Document Preparation, Technical Interviews, Behavioral Interviews and Professional Communication. We will provide some good prompt examples and prompt engineering techniques so you can try it on your own. 

## The benefits of using AI Coach

Here are some benifits for using AI Coach to prepare for software engineering interviews:

- **Comprehensive Preparation:** Covers all aspects of the interview process, ensuring nothing is missed.
- **Accessible and Convenient:** Available 24/7, letting you prepare at your own pace and schedule.
- **Cost-Effective:** A more affordable option compared to traditional coaching services, while still providing personalized support.
- **Instant Feedback:** Allows for quick learning and improvement with immediate feedback and interactive learning opportunities.

Document Preparation (Resumes, Cover Letters, Recommendation Letters):
- **Customized Writing:** The AI Coach can help you edit resumes, cover letters, and recommendation letters to highlight your skills and experiences for the specific job you're applying to.
- **Review and Suggestions:** It can quickly review your drafts, suggest improvements, and highlight areas that might need more detail or a stronger presentation.
- **Grammar and Spelling Checks:** It can identify and correct grammatical errors and typos to make sure your documents are professional and polished.

Technical Interviews (Algorithms, System Design, Computer Science):
- **Practice Problems:** The AI Coach offers a range of problems from algorithms and data structures to system design, helping you improve your technical skills.
- **Interactive Learning:** You can discuss problems and solutions with the AI Coach, which provides explanations and hints if you're stuck, making learning more interactive than just using books or online resources.
- **Mock Interviews:** It can simulate technical interviews, allowing you to practice your coding and problem-solving skills in a realistic interview environment.

Behavioral Interviews:
- **Scenario-Based Practice:** The AI Coach can prepare you for behavioral interview questions by offering scenarios to practice your responses.
- **Feedback on Responses:** It can review your answers to behavioral questions and offer advice on how to improve them to make a good impression.
- **Building Confidence:** Regular practice with the AI chatbot can boost your confidence, reduce interview anxiety, and familiarize you with common interview questions and effective responses.

Professional Communication (Emails with Recruiters, Negotiating Job Offers):
- **Email Writing:** The AI Coach can help you in writing professional emails throughout the job application process, from initial inquiries to thank-you notes after interviews.
- **Offer Negotiation:** It can simulate negotiation scenarios, allowing you to practice discussing and negotiating job offers effectively.

## Prompt Frameworks
In this guide, we will use CRA(Context, Requirements, Action) as our prompt framework. For example, when we ask the AI Coach to write a sonnet in Shakespearean style, we will create a prompt like this:

```
Context: 

"""
Shakespearean sonnets are known for their distinct style and structure,
typically written in iambic pentameter and featuring themes of love, beauty, politics, and mortality.
"""

---

Requirements:

1. The sonnet must consist of 14 lines.
2. It should be written in iambic pentameter.
3. The rhyme scheme should follow the Shakespearean pattern of ABAB CDCD EFEF GG.
4. The theme should focus on the beauty of nature in early spring.

--- 

Action:

"""
Write a sonnet in the style of Shakespeare that captures the essence of early spring's beauty."
"""
```

## Prompt Engineering Course

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting inputs (prompts) to an AI Coach, in a way that maximizes the effectiveness and relevance of its outputs. This involves understanding how the AI Coach interprets and responds to different kinds of input and using this knowledge to design prompts that lead to desired responses. 

If you are new to prompt engineering, we recommend the following courses:

- [Prompt engineering from OpenAI (1.5 hours)](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering)
- [ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers (1 hours)](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/)
