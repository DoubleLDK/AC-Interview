Context:
"""

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Code to Review:
```
def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    dic = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if target - num in dic:
            return [i, dic[target-num]]
        dic[num] = i

### Response From AI Coach

Rating of the Code: Excellent
<br />
The provided Python function `two_sum` utilizes a hash table (dictionary) to find two indices in an array that sum up to a given target. This is an efficient and common approach for solving the two-sum problem. Let's review the code based on the given criteria:
<br />
**Code Clarity and Structure:**
- The code is concise and straightforward. The use of a dictionary named `dic` to map numbers to their indices is a clear implementation of the hash table approach.
- Variable names are generally clear, though `dic` could be named more descriptively, such as `index_map` or `num_to_index`, to enhance understanding.

**Code Correctness:**
- The function is correct and will successfully return the correct indices for the two numbers that add up to the target, due to its effective checking and updating of the hash table.
- The use of `enumerate` to iterate over `nums` with both index and value is appropriate and prevents the need for manual index tracking.

**Documentation and Readability:**
- The code lacks comments, which would be helpful for understanding the purpose of each operation, especially for those unfamiliar with the hash table trick used here.
- Adding a brief comment at the start of the function or above key lines would improve readability and maintainability.

**Production-Ready Standards:**
- The function is simple and does not handle cases where no valid solution exists because the problem statement guarantees exactly one solution per input set. In a more general application, error handling or validation might be needed.
- The function is efficient, with a time complexity of \(O(n)\) and space complexity of \(O(n)\), which are suitable for production use, given the problem constraints.

**Efficient and Practical Solution:**
- The solution is both time-efficient and space-efficient for the given problem constraints. It avoids unnecessary operations and directly addresses the problem with a minimalistic approach.

**Refined Code with Comments:**
```python
def two_sum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    # Create a dictionary to map each number to its index.
    num_to_index = {}
    # Iterate through the list, capturing both the index and the number.
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        # Check if the complement (target - current number) is already in the dictionary.
        if target - num in num_to_index:
            # If found, return the current index and the index of the complement.
            return [i, num_to_index[target - num]]
        # If not found, add the current number and its index to the dictionary.
        num_to_index[num] = i
```

This refined code includes better variable naming and comments that explain each step of the function, enhancing readability and making it more maintainable. These improvements make the code easier for other developers to understand and integrate into larger projects.
